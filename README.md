# Password-list-creator
This tool is one of the best password generators (in my opinion) because it can write any GB of file or any target word you want and it can do this without using any RAM!

First : termux-setup-storage 

Second : pkg install python

Third : git clone https://github.com/yitido11/Password-list-creator

Fourth : cd Password-list-creator

Fifth : python3 Passcreator.py
